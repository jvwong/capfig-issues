# CapFig Issues

This is an issue repository for the [CapFig](https://capfig.com/) add-on in the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/capfig/590438520).

## Overview

CapFig is a lightweight document add-on that helps authors refer to items like figures and tables in their documents. Using CapFig, you create items, label them (e.g. "Figure 1") and insert references to items in your document. When you modify an item (e.g. update an item label from “Figure 1” to “Figure A”), you can synchronize references to the item in your document.
